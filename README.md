# Project-Euler
This is a repository of the project euler math problems I tackle with different languages. The primary goal of this repository is to expand my problem solving skills and my familiarity with other languages.

Many of the solutions featured will may be rough code and works in progress. They are by no means what I deem the best possible solution or structure.

I will also try to have my solutions be functions that can take in a wider array of inputs than the single input the problem states.
