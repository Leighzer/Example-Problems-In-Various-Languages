# Example Problem Repo
This repo is where I hold my many small example projects wher I practice coding in different languages and try formulating new algorithms.

# Project-Euler
This repository also contains my solutions for project euler.

Many of the solutions featured will may be rough code and works in progress. They are by no means what I deem the best possible solution or structure.

Projects with extended in their title mean I have added additional functionality outside of the regular problem specified.
